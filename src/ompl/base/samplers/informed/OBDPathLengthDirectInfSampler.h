            OBDPathLengthDirectInfSampler is a method to generate uniform samples in the subset of a problem that could
           provide a shorter path from start to goal.
            This subset is a prolate hyperspheroid (PHS), a special type of an hyperellipsoid) and can be sampled
           directly.

            Informed sampling is a method to focus search which continuing to consider all homotopy classes that can
           provide a better solution.
            Directly sampling the informed subset guarantees a non-zero probability of improving a solution regardless
           of the size of the planning domain,
            the number of state dimensions, and how close the current solution is to the theoretical minimum.

            Currently only implemented for problems in R^n (i.e., RealVectorStateSpace), SE(2) (i.e., SE2StateSpace),
           and SE(3) (i.e., SE3StateSpace).
            Until an initial solution is found, this sampler simply passes-through to a uniform distribution over the
           entire state space.
